# Expense-Tracker-Project

Team Roles & Tasks

Jason: Designed and implemented the core functionality, including adding, viewing, and deleting expenses.

Jason: Created the README documentation and tested the application for potential bugs.

Challenges & Solutions

Handling invalid inputs: Users sometimes entered incorrect data formats (e.g., letters instead of numbers). We solved this by implementing try-except blocks and clear error messages. Data storage: Since we used an in-memory list, expenses disappeared when the program exited.
